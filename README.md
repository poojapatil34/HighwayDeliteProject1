BookIt: Experiences & Slots is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with a seamless platform to explore travel experiences, check available slots, and make bookings efficiently. The project follows a complete end-to-end architecture, featuring a React + TypeScript frontend styled with TailwindCSS for a clean, responsive, and visually appealing user interface. Users can browse through a list of travel experiences on the Home page, view detailed information such as price, location, and availability on the Details page, and proceed to the Checkout page to confirm their bookings and apply promo codes.
The backend is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB serving as the database for storing experience, slot, and booking details. RESTful APIs handle all CRUD operations and data integration between frontend and backend. The application ensures proper validation for user inputs, prevents double-booking of slots, and manages dynamic responses for success, failure, and sold-out states.
This project demonstrates core full-stack skills, including API design, state management, and responsive UI development. Although it is not yet deployed, it can be easily hosted on platforms like Render or Vercel for live testing and production use.
